# ProdigyInfotech-task1
This Python program implements the Caesar cipher, allowing the user to encrypt or decrypt a given text with a specified shift value. It prompts the user to enter the text, the shift value, and whether to encrypt or decrypt. Based on the chosen operation, it applies the Caesar cipher algorithm and outputs the result.

Description:
This Python program offers a versatile implementation of the Caesar cipher, empowering users to encrypt or decrypt text with a custom shift value. It provides a user-friendly interface, prompting for input text, shift value, and the desired operation (encryption or decryption) via the command line.

Requirements:
Python 3.x installed on the user's system.

Using Software:
Python interpreter for running the program. Text editor or IDE for code modification and execution.

Usage Paradigm:
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to input the text to be processed.
3. Enter the shift value, specifying the amount of shift for encryption/decryption.
4. Choose between encryption or decryption.
5. View the encrypted or decrypted text as output, depending on the selected operation.
